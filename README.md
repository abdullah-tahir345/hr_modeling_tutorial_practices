# hr_modeling_tutorial_practices
Here I have post the tutorials that I have followed and learned a lot of concepts regarding OOP(Object Oriented Programming).

I have learned a different topics of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) by following the real python tutorial and do different
projects for practice. I have learned about these techniques and topics.
<br>
<li>Abstract Class</li>
<li>Constructor Using Inheritance</li>
<li>Super Function</li>
<li>How everything in python is an object?</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Single Inheritance</li>
<li>Hierarchical Inheritance</li>
<li>Multiple Inheritance</li>
<li>MRO (Method Resolution Order)</li>
<li>Composition</li>

<h4>HR Modeling System</h4>
I have learned about different techniques in this project and the techniques that I have learned are given below:
<li>Use of Abstract Class and Abstract Method : Using Abstract class we can't create the object of that class and we have to implement calculate_payroll method in every class and it's know as abstraction.</li>
<li>Disgruntled Class Method : By using this I have made an extra class and by using this DisgruntledEmployee class I have remove the error and make an object which calculate the payroll.</li>
<li>Hierarchical Inheritance : I have used one class and make multiple childern if this base class.</li>
<li>MRO(Method Resolution Order) : By using MRO I have remove hierarchical inheritance and then use Employee Class, HourlyPolicy and SecretaryRole for MRO and calculate the payroll.</li>
<li>Composition Model : Next, I have moved on composition model but this is quite difficult that's why I practice it but still composition model is not clear.</li>
